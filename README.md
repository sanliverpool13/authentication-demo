# Mock Authentication Form

This is a simple authentication form with mocked fetch calls. There is no server. You can find the live here:
[Live App](https://sanliverpool13.github.io/authentication-demo/)

## Approach

- I used Tailwind CSS v4 and created some custom components.
- I mocked fetch calls to the server for login, sign up and reset password. Added a delay to make it seem like a network call.
- Designed the UI on Figma.
- Added some animations to the buttons on submit for loading (tailwind animate spinner), failure (animate custome shake).
- Since this is a mock app, there is no protected or authenticated routes.
